* Annotation: I am interested in networks of people in the context of migration. I am especially interested in the lives of musicians, artists,and writiers who left Russia after 1917 revolution. I like the interface of the "Musicians in Venice" webpage that Ablles et al. created and I would like to create something similar to depict careers, interactions and to trace the trajectory of the lives of people who lefte Russia after the revolution.
