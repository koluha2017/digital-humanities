* Annotation: I am interested in networks of people in the context of migration. I am especially interested in the lives of musicians, artists,and writiers who left Russia after 1917 revolution. I like the interface of the "Musicians in Venice" webpage that Ablles et al. created and I would like to create something similar to depict careers, interactions and to trace the trajectory of the lives of people who lefte Russia after the revolution.

* Annotation: Networks rely on digital tools. I am interested in creating an open source database about the lifes of Russian musicians, artists, and writers who found themselves abroad after the October Revolution. I would also like to know more about the state of digitization of the personal archives of Prokoffiev and Rachmaninoff.
