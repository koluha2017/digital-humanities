* Annotation: I am interested in networks of people in the context of migration. I am especially interested in the lives of musicians, artists,and writiers who left Russia after 1917 revolution. I like the interface of the "Musicians in Venice" webpage that Ablles et al. created and I would like to create something similar to depict careers, interactions and to trace the trajectory of the lives of people who left Russia after the revolution.

* Annotation: Networks rely on digital tools. I am interested in creating an open source database about the lifes of Russian musicians, artists, and writers who found themselves abroad after the October Revolution. I would also like to know more about the state of digitization of the personal archives of Prokoffiev and Rachmaninoff.

* Annotation: Some of the things I am interested in, like diaries, letters, first drafts of scores, etc. may not be available. Also, the time period I am interested in is very sensitive: a lot of people, not just in Russia but all over the world, have diverging views on Russian Revolution. I would like to know how other scholars dealt with that type of problems.
